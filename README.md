## Introduction

Hello there,

I am Clem2095 and I am playing Minecraft since mid-2013.
I am focused on the Feed The Beast Unleashed mod pack and I have few projects
I would like to share with everyone.

Please have a look to the codes there and feel free to use/reuse as per licence.

## Projects

### CC Turtle based tree farm

This is my main focus at the moment.
Yes, there is already plenty of tree farm mechanism, models and machines to do everything
for you, really fast and really 'ready to use', but I do not play Minecraft to get everything
out of the box, the deal for me is to build my farm my own way.

So, it is unlikely the faster, most performant or even the most 'nice looking' farm, but it is
my way, and I am proud of doing it that way.

Feel free to give a try though ;)

Any feedback/comment is always welcome!
